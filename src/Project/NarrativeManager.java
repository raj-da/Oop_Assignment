        The dragon roars one final time, a sound that echoes through the cavern,
        shaking the very walls. Defeated, it collapses, its fiery breath extinguished.
        As the dust settles, the mystical Heart-flower blooms before you, its petals
        shimmering with an ethereal light.

        "You have conquered your fears, your doubts, and even the ancient dragon.
        Your courage and determination have prevailed."

        You carefully pluck the Heart-flower and begin your journey back to your
        daughter, carrying the hope of her recovery with you. You are a true hero,
        King Solomon.
